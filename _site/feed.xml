The Klein-Gordon equation is a wave equation with an additional mass damping term.

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Title:</code> Orbital stability of propagated waves in parabolic systems</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abstract:</code> In these two lectures, we will discuss a class of partial differential equations that models a large range of biological and physical phenomena. Some of their solutions are given as a fixed profile traveling with constant speed.
We will discuss the long time stability of these specific solutions. Due to translational invariance, the linearized dynamics spectrum touches the imaginary axis. As a consequence, it is necessary to distinguish between shape and phase dynamics. I will present the different tools and approaches that where developed in the past fifty years to separate and control these different dynamics. If time allows, we will discuss possible extensions of these tools to open problems.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Title:</code> Stability of propagated fronts in scalar balance laws</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abstract:</code> Scalar balance laws are advection-reaction equations, that appear either in biology or physic when one mesures the variation of a quantity over time. In this presentation, we will focus on specific solutions of these equations, namely propagated waves that connect two distinct constant states. A large variety of such waves can be constructed, and we will discuss the stability of some of them. It is a joint work with L. M. Rodrigues.</p>

Orbital stability for monostable fronts in reaction-diffusion equations</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abstract:</code> 
In this presentation, I will discuss the long-time asymptotic stability of a particular class of travelling waves. Monostable fronts are heteroclinic connections between linearly stable and linearly unstable constant equilibria. Until now, all known stability result assume additional localization of the initial perturbation. We will see how to remove this condition to show orbital stability with respect to phase shift.</p>]]></content><author><name>Louis Garénaux</name><email>louis.garenaux@inria.fr</email></author><category term="seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visiting Karlsruhe for a couple of days, and giving a presentation in the Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations seminar.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New position</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/position/2025/11/17/new-position.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New position" /><published>2025-11-17T12:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-11-17T12:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/position/2025/11/17/new-position</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/position/2025/11/17/new-position.html"><![CDATA[<p>New position starting in January 2026 at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre">INRIA Saclay</a> as a post-doctorate in the project <a href="https://team.inria.fr/musca/">MUSCA</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Louis Garénaux</name><email>louis.garenaux@inria.fr</email></author><category term="position" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[New position starting in January 2026 at INRIA Saclay as a post-doctorate in the project MUSCA.]]></summary></entry></feed>
