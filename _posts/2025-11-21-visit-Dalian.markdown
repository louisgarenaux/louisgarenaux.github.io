Visiting Xian Liao at Dalian University, China for two weeks in December 2025. I will be giving a minicourse "Orbital stability of propagated waves in parabolic systems" at the [Dynamical System seminar][url-ds-seminar] and presentations at the [Differential Equations seminar][url-pde-seminar].

Presentation titles:
- Stability of propagated fronts in scalar balance laws
- Large time dynamics in Klein-Gordon equations
